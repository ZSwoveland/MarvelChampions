This application is meant to be an online version to track your HP in the table top game Marvel Champions.
It is replacing the physical dial and eventually will be able to do scheme management as well. 

This was meant to help with the table clutter and space that might limit in some cases. 4 players matches take up the most space while 1 player takes up the least.

Thank You for testing and using the Web Application
